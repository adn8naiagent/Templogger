CRITICAL CODE SAFETY:

NEVER PUSH TO MAIN BRANCH ON GITHUB. YOU ARE UNAUTHORIZED FROM EVERY TOUCHING THIS BRANCH. ONLY EVER PUSH TO DEV

CRITICAL DATABASE RULES:

Never use DROP, DELETE, TRUNCATE on schema
Only add tables/columns, never remove
Read .database-safety-rules.md first

## Make DB schema changes to the Dev database as well as local schema to ensure sync
- When making schema changes, ALWAYS apply them to dev database in real time
- Use "npx prisma migrate deploy" after creating migration files
- This prevents schema drift when changes are merged to main
- Dev database must stay synchronized with schema files during development
- GitHub Actions only updates production, not dev - so dev must be updated manually

Run code quality checks after changes
