Enhance the existing fridge temperature logging app with the following new features:

GOAL
- Compliance = required temperature logs are entered within defined time windows.
- Out-of-range temps still count as “entered” but must be flagged.
- Users must be able to define how many checks per day each fridge requires, with time windows for each.

FEATURES TO ADD

1) Fridge Setup & Scheduling
- For each fridge: allow the user to define number of checks per day and the specific time windows for those checks.
- Each window should have a label (e.g. “Morning”), a start time, and an end time.
- Validate that time windows don’t overlap.

2) Manual Temp Entry
- When logging a temp, the app should automatically detect the current time window.
- If outside of the correct window, warn and require a reason (“late entry”).
- If temp is out of range, flag as “Out of Range” and prompt for corrective action (dropdown + note/photo).

3) Compliance Tracking
- Track compliance at three levels:
  - Per-window (completed on time = compliant).
  - Per-fridge per day (all windows completed).
  - Overall (percentage of compliant fridge-days).
- Compliance is based only on whether entries were made in the required windows (not whether values were in range).

4) Dashboard (Live Compliance)
- Show overall compliance % for today, number of fridges compliant vs. total, missed windows, and out-of-range events.
- Each fridge tile should display: status (On Track / Missed Window / Out of Range), how many checks are complete, and how many remain.

5) Calendar View (Compliance Heatmap)
- Monthly view with color codes:
  - Green = fully compliant
  - Red = missed windows
  - Amber = partial/late entries
  - Blue = upcoming/scheduled
- Clicking a day shows details of logs, who entered them, and any flags.

6) Insights
- Show weekly and monthly compliance trends.
- Identify problem windows with highest miss rates.
- Summarize frequency of out-of-range events.
- Show staff accountability: who performs most logs, who logs late, etc.

7) Custom Checklists
- Allow admins to create custom checklists (e.g., “Weekly Clean,” “Open/Close Routine”).
- Checklist items can be required or optional.
- Checklists can be tied to a fridge or to a schedule (daily, weekly, monthly).
- Completed checklists should also show up in compliance insights (separate from temp logging).

8) Data Exports
- Allow users to export:
  - Raw temperature logs (with timestamps, fridge, window, user, notes, corrective actions).
  - Compliance summaries (daily, weekly, monthly).
  - Out-of-range events.
  - Checklist completions.
- Provide “Export last 30 days” and custom date ranges.

9) Notifications (basic version)
- End-of-day summary email listing missed windows.
- Optional immediate alert for out-of-range entries.
- Allow per-fridge toggle for notifications.

10) Roles & Permissions
- Admin: manage fridges, schedules, users, checklists, exports.
- Manager: view dashboards, insights, exports.
- Staff: log temps and complete checklists.
